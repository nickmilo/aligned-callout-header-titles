This does a very tiny thing, vertically center-align callout titles that use markdown headers. I hope Obsidian just adds this eventually. Fingers crossed.

Here's the default behavior in the default theme.

Here's the new behavior in the default theme.

![aligned-callout-header-titles](https://github.com/nickmilo/aligned-callout-header-titles/assets/35411533/ddbbb5d8-fd0b-4f73-a58a-18ec76310490)

## Steps to get it working

1. Download it.
2. Put it in your snippets folder (within the .Obsidian folder)
3. Go to Obsidian > Settings > Appearance
4. Scroll to the bottom, refresh the snippets.
5. Toggle on `aligned-callout-header-titles`

Enjoy,
Nick
